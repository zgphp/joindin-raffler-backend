Drupal8 is not powered by full-stack Symfony and there is still many differences between these two relatives, but still, Symfony developers should master it easily. This talk is for Symfony developers who don't have experience with Drupal8. It will guide you through routing, controllers, hooks, events, Drupal Console, DI and many other interesting elements that power Drupal8 under the hood. It will also show how to build custom modules Symfony way. \r\n\r\nLjubo Canic: Abstracting conditional statements\r\n\r\nWe often find ourselves writing conditional statements (if...then...else) to branch our code or to shape some data ie. branching code execution to either include or exclude data, but we can use some functional programming to simplify code which can lead to better understanding and maintainability.\r\n\r\nSchedule \r\n\r\n17:30 - Warm up and small talk \r\n\r\n18:00 - Group announcements \r\n\r\n18:05 - Antonio Peri?: Drupal 8 for Symfony developers\r\n\r\n18:50 - Break \r\n\r\n18:55 - Ljubo ?ani?: Abstracting conditional statements\r\n\r\n19:20 - Drinkup",

Slaven Vinceti\u0107 from Degordian will share his tips and tricks for handling junior developers and encouraging senior developers to contribute with their experience. All that, packed in a talk, with lots of references to Star Wars.\n\nAfter the break, Marin Crnkovi\u0107 from web.burza will introduce us to SaltStack - provisioning system that looks to stir some fun in field traditionally owned by Chef, Puppet and Ansible. Enter SaltStack, the remote execution, configuration management system that uses YAML files (psst, they are in fact Twig!). This talk will provide a crash course on the basics of Salt with some examples and use cases and to get you from \"I install my software by hand\" to \"I used to install by hand, but now I love my life\".",
